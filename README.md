# SW Service

The `sw-service` package streamlines the registration of Service Workers on client devices, simplifying the process of delivering enhanced functionality and offline capabilities through Progressive Web Apps. This package offers a user-friendly approach to managing PWA installations, providing a seamless experience for both developers and end users.

If you are looking for a tool to generate the Service Worker for your app, some options are: [sw-builder](https://github.com/jesusgraterol/sw-builder) and [PWA Builder](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/sw-intro).
